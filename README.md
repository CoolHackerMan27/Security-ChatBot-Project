# Security-ChatBot-Project

Simillar to the Security-Ai-Project, but using a completly custom trained chatbot.

All of the dataproccessing code came from sentdex's "Creating a Chatbot" series. Here is the link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvOnYLDg8_Y&amp;ab_channel=sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvOnYLDg8_Y&ab_channel=sentdex)
This is mostly my own creation (with the help of lots of online tools and _some_ AI ofc). This could be a good jumping off point for someone looking into getting into language models anre more complex training.
